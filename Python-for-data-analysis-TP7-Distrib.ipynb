    "Last time we've scratched the surface of ML with Sci Kit Learn. We've loaded example datasets, learned how to split data into train set and train set, choosed some classifiers, manually decided some hyperparameter, trained the model and evaluated it using accuracy.\n",

    "This time you will dig further using various online materials. You will learn new metrics to validate the efficiency of your model, and also methods to automatically choose the best combination of hyperparameters for your models.\n",
